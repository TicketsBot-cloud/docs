# Exit Survey
***

Users can be requested to leave feedback when their ticket is closed.

## Enable Exit Survey
1. Ensure [user feedback](feedback.md#enabling-feedback) (star rating) is enabled
2. Create a [form](../../features/forms.md), as you normally would, but enter your feedback questions
3. Edit your [panels](../../setup/panels.md) and set the `Exit Survey Form` input to this new form

The next time a user rates a ticket, they will also be prompted to fill out the feedback form.

## View Exit Survey Responses
When a user leaves a survey response, the archive message in your `Transcript Channel` will be updated with a button to view their response.
